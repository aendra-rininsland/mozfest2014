##  Abstracted Descriptive

+ An abstraction of a descriptive library (i.e., d3.js)
+ Far less code required
+ Output restricted to predefined templates
+ Less work, basics are already in place
+ Not as customisable as descriptive, but tweaking outputs still possible
+ Great for creating charts with a high degree of control
+ e.g.: nvd3, C3js
   + to a lesser extent, The JavaScript Infovis Toolkit, HighCharts, etc.
